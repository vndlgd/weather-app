# Weather App

This project, developed as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript course, focuses on creating a weather forecast site using the WeatherAPI. The key functionalities include location-based weather searches, the ability to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature units, and displaying weather-related images.

### API Keys, Secrets, and Security

API keys are valuable and can incur costs if misused. It is essential to handle them securely. This project emphasizes the importance of not trusting the client (frontend) with sensitive information like API keys. While this project exposes the API key on GitHub, it is acceptable as the key is publicly available with no consequences. However, not all keys should be treated this way, and future backend courses will cover secure handling methods.

## Notes

This project is designed for individual learning and serves as a personal exploration, aiming to solidify understanding of callbacks, promises, async/await, and effective API usage in web development.
